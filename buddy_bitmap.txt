Define the buddy system as a complete binary tree. A node may be 0 or 1
. Its value is 1, if and only if all of its children have a value of 1.
1

1 2 3 4

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

Implement the following methods.
1' clearBit(int offset, int len);
2' setBit(int offset, int len);

Sol: Its a complete Binary tree so figure out the start and end and go up the tree from the bottom. Note clear only needs to reset
For setbit we need to keep track of the element outside boundary otherwise its just set
